            "ESS is a long-duration energy storage company specializing in iron flow battery technology. We design and produce long-duration batteries predominantly using earth-abundant materials that we believe can be cycled over 20,000 times without capacity fade. Because we designed our batteries to operate using an electrolyte of primarily salt, iron and water, our products are environmentally sustainable and substantially recyclable or reusable. Our batteries provide flexibility to grid operators and energy assurance for commercial and industrial customers. Our technology addresses energy delivery, duration and cycle life in a single battery platform that compares favorably to lithium-ion batteries, the most widely deployed alternative technology. We design and build this core technology, including battery stacks, electrolyte and electrolyte health management solutions into a core power train that is then sold in a variety of configurations to create distinct products that meet the various needs of the industry. These include our smaller-scale Energy Warehouse, larger containerized Energy Centers, gigawatt-scale fully configurable Energy Base and core power trains that can be assembled at the customer site into complete storage solutions. With each battery deployed, we further our mission to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon energy future with increased grid reliability. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our batteries are non-flammable and can operate in a wide range of temperatures from -15&#176;C to 50&#176;C with minimal auxiliary loads. This allows our energy storage products to be located in sites where lithium-ion batteries cannot be placed due to fire, chemical or explosion risks. In addition, our batteries are environmentally sustainable, predominantly utilizing readily sourced materials and recyclable or reusable components. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our batteries and technology can be purchased with an extended ten-year warranty which is backed by investment-grade, warranty and project insurance policies from Munich Re, a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance and insurance-related risk solutions, which stands behind the performance of our energy storage products. To our knowledge, we are the first long-duration energy storage company to receive this type of insurance, which provides a warranty backstop for our proprietary flow battery technology, supporting our performance obligations regardless of project size or location and de-risking the technology for our customers. We have also collaborated with Munich Re to develop separate project coverage for our customers. This project coverage provides warranty continuity insurance in the event of our insolvency, providing long-term assurance of project performance to our customers and their investors and lenders. Bonding and surety capital is provided through OneBeacon Insurance Group (&#8220;OneBeacon&#8221;) as well as qualification from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which provides additional product assurance. We believe each of these elements allows us to increase our total addressable market, as potential customers have reduced technology risk, financing risk and importing risk. \n",

            "Our long-duration iron flow batteries are the product of nearly 50 years of scientific advancement. In the 1970s, researchers first developed the concept of iron flow batteries. Despite realizing the batteries&#8217; promising ability to store energy, these researchers found that the reaction between the positive and negative sides created hydroxide formations that clogged the electrodes and reduced the activity of the electrolytes. Hydroxide formation caused rapid degradation in early iron flow batteries after only a few cycles. Unable to prevent the hydroxide from forming, these scientists were forced to abandon their work. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our founders, Craig Evans and Dr. Julia Song, began advancing this technology in 2011 and formed Legacy ESS. Building upon this promising concept, our team has significantly enhanced the technology, improved round-trip efficiency and developed an innovative and patented solution to the hydroxide build-up problem. Our proprietary solution to eliminate the hydroxide formation is known as the Proton Pump, and it works by utilizing hydrogen generated by side reactions on the negative electrode. The Proton Pump converts the hydrogen back into protons in the positive electrolyte. This process eliminates the hydroxide and stabilizes the pH level of the system. The Proton Pump allows the electrolyte to be used for the 20,000 cycle-design without capacity fade. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our iron flow batteries store energy by converting electrical energy into chemical energy. Each battery module is made up of one or more cells and each of these cells is made up of a negative electrode and a positive electrode, and these two electrodes are separated by a porous separator. On the positive side (positive electrode) of the battery during charge, ferrous iron (Fe+2) is oxidized into ferric iron (Fe+3) and on the negative side (negative electrode) of the battery, ferrous iron is reduced to iron metal. The porous separator is used to minimize the positive and the negative electrolyte from mixing, which helps improve the coulombic efficiency of the battery. The positive and negative electrolytes are stored separately in tanks outside of the battery and this electrolyte is constantly pumped in and out of the battery while in operation. To convert the chemical energy back to electrical energy, the reaction is reversed; on the positive side of the battery, ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron and on the negative side, metallic iron is oxidized into ferrous iron. During these charge and discharge cycles the pH of the positive and negative electrolyte can change dramatically. The Proton Pump ensures that the electrolyte pH remains stable and clear of any hydroxides. \n",
            "\n",
            "Our iron flow batteries store energy by charging positive and negative electrolyte tanks that are separated by a membrane. In order to release energy, we generate a reaction between the tanks via the membrane. The power generated is a factor of the membrane size, while the duration of storage we can offer is a factor of the tank sizes and the addition of electrolytes to the tank, which can be accomplished at a relatively low cost. The duration of stored energy can be independently varied from the power. This allows for low marginal costs of energy, making our technology attractive for long-duration energy storage. \n",

Our first energy storage product, the Energy Warehouse, is designed as a &#8216;behind-the-meter&#8217; solution and is often used for initial testing and technology verification. Our second, larger scale energy storage product, the Energy Center, is designed to be a complete battery solution delivered in a modular, stackable form factor that can be deployed either &#8216;behind-the-meter&#8217;, at commercial/industrial sites or in micro-grid deployments, or &#8216;front-of-the-meter&#8217; for large-scale grid applications. The Energy Center is designed to allow customers to connect multiple units in a variety of configurations, supporting energy storage projects ranging from sub-megawatt to tens-of-megawatt scale. The Energy Center is configured with higher power and longer duration than the Energy Warehouse, and the modular design allows customers to meet the specific requirements of their application as needed. Our third, gigawatt-scale storage product, the Energy Base, is designed with a fully configurable layout that integrates with any site location and that allows the power (the rate of electricity flow) to be decoupled from the capacity (the total amount of energy held). This, combined with an expectation of unlimited cycling and rapid response time, means that the performance of each Energy Base can be tailored to meet individual customer needs. As a result, users have the flexibility to use the battery for various use cases simultaneously on a project. \n",
